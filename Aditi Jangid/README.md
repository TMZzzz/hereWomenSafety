**Project Title**: Women Safety Empower<br>
<hr>
**Introduction** : We are probably living in the worst time our modern society has ever seen in terms of women security. We aim to make women feel as strong as ever and strong enough to fight the parasites of our society, strong enough to fight the odds, strong enough to protect themselves against any sexual assaults. We aim at giving power to those without whom we cease to exist. Our idea is to design a system which shall make every place and every hour safer for women again. A system which shall re-establish how very gregarious mankind is. This system shall geotag and send SOS alert to the nearest police station, close contacts and also alert people in and around the venue of the crime, everything just at a click of a button. The idea is to make up for the time it takes police to arrive at the location.

**Problems** :Among the worst countries in crime, India has an abhorrent track record in all forms of sexual exploitation. In homes, on streets, in public transports and even offices. Indian women are in a constant state of vigilance, like a country on terrorist alert. There have been grotesque cases of rapes of toddlers, gang rape of eight years old and women trafficking. We have created a nation where women are learning to cope with existential anxiety and we should be ashamed.
A lot of NGOs, rehabilitation centres and helpline numbers have been made operational in the past years but they are all cures to the harassment that has already happened and not the ‘preventions’ that we need. There are certain pre-existing apps that do send a message to the saved contacts but none of them is effective and quick enough and according to a survey, the existing technology doesn’t make most women feel safe. A major change in the basic structure and a few add-ons to these is a necessity. In a lot of cases, it is observed that women do not file a complaint against the accused because of various reasons like not knowing the correct authority to report it to or feeling ashamed/guilty about the incident.
